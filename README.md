# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
----------------------------------------------------
This project shows how to train a generative adversarial network to generate images.

A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a type of deep learning network that can generate data with similar characteristics as the input real data.

This project trains a GAN to generate images using the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/tf_flowers">tf_flowers dataset</a>, which contains images of flowers.
